## Gram Formula Mass Calculator
GFM Calculator is a simple command-line utility for calculating the gram formula mass (or atomic weight) of a molecular compound.

The individual elements' gram formula mass was pulled from this [site](https://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/structure_mass.htm).

GFM Calculator requires a molecular compound to be given in algebraic notation.
For example, H<sub>2</sub>O must be represented as `2*H + O`.
Note that the amount of elements must come before the element itself in the `*` expression. Referencing the example above, `H*2` is not permitted, only `2*H`.
